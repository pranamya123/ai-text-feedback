## History of Large Wildfires in California

**Overview**

Large wildfires—defined as those burning over 1,000 acres—have become a defining and devastating feature of California’s landscape, particularly in recent decades. These fires are responsible for the majority of property destruction, fatalities, and economic losses associated with wildfires in the state. The increasing frequency and severity of large wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change, accumulated fuels from decades of fire suppression, and expanding development into fire-prone areas[2][5].

**Recent Trends and Major Incidents**

The 21st century has seen a marked escalation in both the number and size of large wildfires in California. Notably, 15 of the 20 largest wildfires in the state’s recorded history have occurred since 2000[2]. The 2025 fire season has already proven historic, with a series of 14 destructive wildfires from January 7 to 31, 2025, affecting Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Ventura counties[1][5]. These fires were fueled by severe drought, low humidity, and hurricane-force Santa Ana winds, which in some places reached 100 mph[1].

- **Scale and Impact:** Over 57,000 acres burned, more than 18,000 structures destroyed or damaged, 30 confirmed deaths, and over 200,000 people evacuated[1][5].
- **Most Destructive Fires:** The Eaton Fire in Altadena (14,021 acres, 9,418 structures destroyed, 17 deaths) and the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades (23,448 acres, 6,837 structures destroyed, 12 deaths) were the second and third-most destructive wildfires in California history, respectively[1][5][6].
- **Firefighting Response:** Municipal and CAL FIRE teams, supported by tactical aircraft, fought these fires under extremely challenging conditions[1].

**Historical Context and Notable Fires**

| Fire Name      | Year | Acres Burned | Structures Destroyed | Fatalities | County         |
|----------------|------|--------------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| Camp Fire      | 2018 | 153,336      | 18,804              | 85         | Butte         |
| Tubbs Fire     | 2017 | 36,807       | 5,636               | 22         | Napa/Sonoma   |
| North Complex  | 2020 | 318,935      | 2,352               | 15         | Butte/Plumas/Yuba |
| Cedar Fire     | 2003 | 273,246      | 2,820               | 15         | San Diego     |
| Eaton Fire     | 2025 | 14,021       | 9,418               | 17         | Los Angeles   |
| Palisades Fire | 2025 | 23,448       | 6,837               | 12         | Los Angeles   |

The 2018 Camp Fire remains the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history, with 85 fatalities and over 18,000 structures destroyed[2][6]. The 2025 Eaton and Palisades fires now rank just behind Camp Fire in destructiveness, underscoring the increasing severity of recent events[1][5][6].

**Contributing Factors**

- **Climate Change:** Rising temperatures and persistent drought have dried out vegetation, creating ideal conditions for large fires to ignite and spread rapidly[1][4][5].
- **Fuel Accumulation:** Decades of fire suppression have led to dense forests and brush, providing ample fuel for large, fast-moving fires[1][2].
- **Urban Expansion:** Development into wildland areas has increased the number of structures and people at risk, amplifying the destructive potential of large fires[1][7].

**Economic and Social Impacts**

- **Direct Losses:** The January 2025 wildfires resulted in the destruction or damage of over 18,000 structures and at least 30 deaths[1][5].
- **Economic Fallout:** Preliminary estimates put the economic losses at over $250 billion, making these fires the costliest in U.S. history. The losses include homes, businesses, schools, and churches, with at least 12,300 such structures destroyed[7]. The fires have severely disrupted local economies, particularly in tourism and film, and have caused significant declines in consumption, production, and employment[3][7].
- **Insurance and Fiscal Effects:** The scale of destruction is expected to drive up insurance premiums and strain both state and local budgets due to increased emergency response and rebuilding costs[3][7].

**Firefighting and Resource Allocation**

Large fires strain firefighting resources, requiring extensive coordination and deployment:
- In January 2025, over 1,400 fire engines and 84 aircraft were mobilized to battle the Southern California blazes[1].
- The sheer scale of these incidents often forces prioritization of life and property protection over containment, leading to prolonged firefighting campaigns.

**Long-term Challenges**

- **Recovery:** The massive loss of homes and infrastructure means recovery will take years. Displaced residents face housing shortages, while businesses contend with lost revenue and rebuilding costs[7].
- **Future Risk:** Ongoing drought and climate trends suggest that large, destructive wildfires will remain a persistent threat, especially in Southern California where the 2024–2025 wet season brought less than 25% of average precipitation[4].

**Conclusion**

Large wildfires have become increasingly frequent and destructive in California, with recent events setting new records for devastation. The 2025 fire season, particularly the Eaton and Palisades fires, highlights the urgent need for improved land management, climate adaptation, and emergency preparedness to confront this escalating crisis[1][4][5][7].
